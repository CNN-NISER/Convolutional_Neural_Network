# Convolutional_Neural_Network using NumPy
This repository contains Python code (without the use of any packages, apart from NumPy) for Convolutional Neural Networks. A user can enter any number of convolutional and pooling layers at whatever order. The user can however add only one Fully Connected Layer. 

We initialised weights through random number initialisation. The Rectified Linear Unit is used as the activation function and parameter sharing is enabled for this CNN. L2 norm has been used for the loss function, without paramter regularisation.

## Future Updates
1. The option to add any number of FC Layers. 

2. Inclusion of Biases.

3. Parameter regularisation in loss function.
