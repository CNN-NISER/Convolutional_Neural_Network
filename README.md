# Convolutional_Neural_Network
This repository contains Python code (without the use of any packages, apart from NumPy) for Convolutional Neural Networks. A user can enter any number of convolutional and pooling layers at whatever order.

We initialised weights through random number initialisation. The Rectified Linear Unit is used as the activation function and parameter sharing is enabled for this CNN.

As of now, only the forward pass has been coded for. Gradient descent and backpropagation will be added soon, after which it would be a fully functional CNN.
