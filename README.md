# Convolutional_Neural_Network using NumPy
This repository contains Python code (without the use of any packages, apart from NumPy) for Convolutional Neural Networks. A user can enter any number of convolutional and pooling layers at whatever order. The user can however add only one Fully Connected Layer. Further updates would involve the ability to add any number of FC Layers. 

We initialised weights through random number initialisation. The Rectified Linear Unit is used as the activation function and parameter sharing is enabled for this CNN.
